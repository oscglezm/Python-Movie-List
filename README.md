# Python-Movie-Trailer
Simple website built with Python to display my list of popular movies. 

I. Run "Movie Trailer Website"
-------------------------------

Open up your terminal and run:

$ `python`

It should return some version of Python *2.7*. If you are running Python *3.0*, you will need to run some sort of virtual environment: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

If Python is not installed at all, see the documentation here: https://www.python.org


II. Execute the program:
------------------------
$ `python entertainment.py`

- A browser should open on your local machine and and render the HTML template: __fresh_tomatoes.html__


III. File List
--------------
 - **media.py**: It contains two classes definition, movie and series class.
 - **fresh_tomatoes.py**: It brings the website template.
 - **entertaiment_center.py**: It provides the instance for each movie and series in order to pass the list to the fresh_tomatoes.py and shows the content.
